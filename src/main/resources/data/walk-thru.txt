Ultima VI The False Prophet, IBM version 3.2
This "walkthru" by Wyvern

     ULTIMA VI from Origin and Lord British is the sixth game in the 
Ultima series. Great improvements to the graphics are to be enjoyed 
in this game, but it does not compensate for the buggy program, poor
documentation of the commands and little improvement in the actual
plot/game itself. 
     Be certain to set you game up properly or it will run very slowly.
     The screen is divided into four sections: map, status display, 
message area and command icons. The map area is so small that until 
you have played the game for a while it is far to easy to get 
disoriented. I would prefer a larger map area.
     Do NOT use the mouse! Although the docs {such as they are} says 
that mouse is supported it simply does not work well. The keyboard 
works fine once you get used to it. Commands are NOT well explained. 
It took me a couple of hours to figure out how to move items from 
one character to another, drop items, etc. Much attention was given 
to the compendium. I wish such attention had been given to the 
instructions. 
     You begin the game with 3 other companions in Lord British's 
castle. You also begin IN a fight. This is not a nice way to start a 
game. Frankly at this point you are not familiar enough with the 
commands to handle a fight easily. My group managed to scrape 
through and Lord B did heal us completely right afterwards, but I 
think it was a poor game choice. 
     Your beginning group is: Yourself, Dupre, Shamino, and Iolo. 
Talk to them. Iolo can gather or split all the gold in the party 
for you {would be nice if the docs told you these things rather than 
leaving it to the player to find out by random chance}. Later in the 
game you will find others who are willing to join your group. 
Everyone who is willing to join you is not necessarily worth having 
join you. Some of them are poorly equipped, others have poor stats, 
or both. Having extra people in your group can sometimes be an 
advantage even if they are not the best. To ask them to join or 
leave your party, talk to them. 
     Another word of caution: Many BUGS have been reported on this game.
I see little excuse, save greed, for a game to be released to the public 
with such obvious bugs. Unfortunately this practice seems to be becoming 
the rule rather than the exception these days. You can send in your disks
for replacements. You should also make backups of your character files
often or you may find yourself restarting the game. Don't just overwrite
your past backups, make different copies. That way you will have a
chance to save what playing time you have put in. Some bugs can be avoided 
by limiting your inventory and later in the game reducing your party to the
original four {avatar, Dupre, Samino, Iolo}.

STARTING OUT:
     You begin the game in Lord British's castle. Lord B will tell you 
how the shrines are under the control of the gargoyles and must be freed.
There is equipment for your use in the castle, in your room and in others. 
Talk to everyone you meet. Ask their name and job to get clues as to 
further conversation. Talk to the mage in L. B's castle. He will tell you 
about Iolo's book and to consult Mariah {in Lycaeum}.

INVENTORY HINTS:
     Major BUGS are related to character's inventory so keep only what you
need, food, reagents, and the like. Some items you will need to keep until
they have been used. Once used, you can drop them {such as Rune Stones and
pieces to the pirates treasure map} To WIN the game you will need:

     Vortex Cube {loaded with the 8 Moonstones}
     2 Vortex Lens

     It will be very useful to have a strong character in your party carry
a skiff. There are areas you will want to reach {such as Dungeon Shame}
that you will be unable to reach without a skiff.

SEWERS: good for gold and experience
     In the potion laboratory in the castle, you will find a ladder to
the sewers below the castle. This is the best place to start out your
characters. It is larger than it looks. Use all ladders you find until you
are familiar with where they lead. On level 2 of the sewers you will find
an underground lake. Phoenix lives to the north of the lake. When you have
gotten the PICKPOCKET spell, seek out Phoenix and take her thieve's belt.

SHRINES:
     After you have spent a little time in the sewers earning gold and
experience, its time to visit the wide world. Your purpose at this point 
is to free the shrines from the hold of the gargoyles. The shrine of
Compassion {east of Britannia} is the easiest to free early in the game
having fewer gargoyles guarding the shrine. At other shrines, you may
find it easier to cast invisibiity upon your avatar and have him/her
free the shrine alone thus avoiding a fight with the gargoyles. To free
a shrine USE the rune on the shrine and chant the mantra. The force
field upon the shrine will be broken. Take the MOONSTONE!

EXPLORE and GAIN EXPERIENCE:
Here is a list of some of the major areas of interest in the game. As
noted, some contain important clues or items while others are primarily
good for gaining experience. Many of the caves are connected.

* Books: The book of lost mantras if shown to Wisps will get you the
         8th level spell of Armageddon {which you do NOT need}
         The book Wizard of Oz when given to Lord British will get
         you some gems as reward.

KARMA:
     Karma is important in this game. To maintain and increase Karma, do 
not steal, return the rune of honor to Trinsic, do good deeds {such as
getting dragon eggs for Sandy the cook in Trinsic}

PIRATES' MAP & TABLET:
     Talking to Mariah in Lycaeum will reveal that a second portion of
the tablet will be needed to translate it fully. Mariah directs you to
Zoltar the gypsy. Zoltar will tell you that pirates stole the other
portion of the tablet. To locate this second piece of tablet you will
need:
     Thieves Belt - sewers under LB's to join the Thieves Guild to be
                    able to get any information from HOMER on Bucaneer
                    Den.
Homer will tell you that there are 9 pieces to the map of Captain
Hawkin's treasure {the location of the 2nd piece of tablet}. Homer has
one of the nine pieces. The others are at:
     Shipwreck         -     71S, 14E
     Ant Mound         -     4th level
     Dungeon Shame     
     Dungeon Wrong
Giving Sandy, the cook in Trinsic, dragon eggs will tell you the other
locations of map pieces:
     Serpent's Hold    -     A woman to the east has a piece. You will
                             need to give her a Magic Shield to get it.
     Dagger Isle       -     Hermits cellar {move harpsicord}
     Bad gypsies       -     Buy or pickpocket the piece {N of Paws}
     Mayor of Trinsic  -     Confront mayor with name "GORDON"
After collecting 8 pieces return to HOMER. He will give you the last piece 
and tell you how many paces to move before digging {you will need a SHOVEL}.
Drop the map pieces and move them around until you get a clear map of the
location of the treasure.
TREASURE: Small island to southwest of Bucaneer's Den with 3 stones in 
northeast corner. Walk 3 steps south, 9 steps west, 12 steps south. DIG!
This will reveal a hole that you can enter. Explore this area {which has
many traps} until you find the sign: "Drop to your Death", choose the
hole that has a gold nugget next to it to find the TABLET.
     Return to Bucaneer's Den and give Storm Cloak to Homer.
     Return to Lycaeum with both parts of the tablet and talk to Mariah.

GARGOYLES:
     Mariah will supply some additional information on why the gargoyles
are causing so much trouble now. She will direct you to Sin Vraal {south
of shrine of sacrifice} who will tell you that you can enter the 
gargoyle world through Hythloth. 
     Dungeon Hythloth is to be found near the Shrine of Humility {lower
right portion of the map}. You will find Captain Johne on the bottom
level. He will tell you about the gargoyles and give you a scroll that
will allow you to talk to gargoyles. Cpt. Johne will also tell you about
Beh Lem a gargoyle who will help you get around the gargoyle city without
being attacked. Beh Lem is to be found just outside of Dungeon Hythloth
on the gargoyle plane.
     Talk to Beh Lem. He will tell you to see his father and give you 
instructions on how to find him. Beh's father will tell you that you need
to visit the gargoyle Inquisitor {Lord Draxinusom} and surrender as well
as the need for you to make a sacrifice to help mend the two worlds, that
of humans and gargoyles. Naxatilor is the gargoyle who will be able to 
explain sacrifice to you more clearly.
     Go see Lord Drax and surrender. Drax will ask that you submit to 
wearing an amulet of submission. Dupre will warn you that it is a magical
trick, ignore him. Once you are wearing the amulet, you will be able to
travel freely around the gargoyle world and talk with its inhabitants.         
     Now visit Nax {who lives across the way from Drax and learn more about
sacrifice. Sacrifice, to gargoyles, can mean one of three things: self,
others or valuables. When asked which you wish to sacrifice, answer "value".
Nax informs you that the Codex is the only thing of real value. Nax will
ask if you wish to destroy the Codex, answer "no". Nax will then suggest
that you return the Codex to the void. Here at last is your true mission
in this game!
     Visit the Hall of Knowledge to read the Book of Rituals and to get
the vortex lens {it is broken and you will need to have it repaired by
the gargoyle lens maker who lives east of the gargoyle city}. After doing
these errands and returning to Nax where needed for additional instructions,
you will be told that you need a concave vortex lens to represent humans
and to read the Codex for instructions on what to do with the lenses and
the vortex cube {loaded with the 8 moonstones}. The vortex CUBE is supposed to 
be in the Hall of Knowledge but you will find it missing. Asking the gargoyle 
who cares for the Hall, you will learn that the Cube was stolen by humans who 
went to StoneGate. StoneGate is the castle that lies in the mountains south of 
Minoc. You will need to find secret passages as well as do a couple of errands 
for the Ogres that live there to get the vortex Cube.
     The mage that lives across the river near Lycaeum will be able to make
you a concave vortex lens if you can give him a glass sword. Glass swords
can be found on Phoenix in the sewers.
     You will not be able to enter the temple of the Codex unless you are
on a quest. THere is only one way to be put on a quest and that is to
visit the Shrine of Singularity {in the gargoyle world}. To visit the
Shrine of Singularity you will need a balloon. Plans for making a balloon
can be found on a dead body in the dungeon under Sutek's. Once you have the 
balloon plans you will need to visit: 
Minoc to have the basket woven {300gp},
Paws  to buy rope {5gp} 
      to have silk thread spun {have lots of spider silk for this} {10gp}
New Magincia to have the thread woven into cloth {20gp}
Paws  to have the cloth sewn into a large bag {75gp}
You also need a cauldron {dungeon wrong is a good source for this} and an 
anchor.
USE the balloon plans to make a balloon. Have one of your strong characters
carry the balloon. Use a moongate to get to the gargoyle altar {see moon-
gate chart above}. Go north and a little to the right, drop the balloon and
then use it. Use the FAN to change the wind to S so that you may travel
north. Once past the mountains, land and enter the Shrine of Singularity.
     TALK to the altar. When asked what you want, answer "quest". You will
be asked for whom you seek this quest of the Codex, answer "all". The
shrine will tell you to visit the shrines representing the gargoyle virtues
Control, Passion & Diligence. Each of these shrines contains a statue with
which you must talk to learn the mantra of that virtue. The three virtues 
combined equal the mantra for the Singularity. Use the balloon to return south 
of the mountains, back to near the gargoyle altar. 
     The entrances to the shrines of Control, Passion and Diligence are
found on the island of the gargoyle world {which is not that large}. The 
catacombs of Diligence are the hardest to get through. There is a secret door 
leading to a ladder near the lower left corner of the catacombs. This secret 
door is NOT on an outer wall. 
     After you have visited all three shrines and learned the mantras, return 
to the Shrine of Singularity. When asked if you have visited all three shrines 
answer yes and then chant the mantra UNORUS. You now have a quest and may 
enter the temple containing the Codex!
     Use the Moon Orb to get to the Temple of the Codex and read it {LOOK}. 
Follow the instructions to place the two lenses and the Cube loaded with all 
eight moonstones then USE the Cube! 
     You will see a series of pictures that culminate in the END GAME!
     CONGRATS!

{alt} commands:
     There are 3 {alt} commands that work in this game {through version
3.2}. These are "debugging tools" that were left in the game.
To use them press the alt key and then the three numbers before releasing
the alt key.

{alt} 213  -     This command will give you the same over view that a gem
                 would plus a string of numbers. The first 2 numbers are
                 your character's karma, the next four are the time, the
                 next three are the first coordinates, the three after that
                 are the second coordinates and the last number is the 
                 "plane". Example: 7510260170161
                 75   = karma
                 1026 = time
                 017  = 1st coordinates }
                 016  = 2nd coordinates }====Shrine of Spirituality
                 1    = plane           }

{alt} 214  -     This command will allow you to teleport from where you are
                 to another location. Example: To get to the Shrine of
                 Spirituality, you would type:
                 017 {return}
                 016 {return}
                 1   {return}   and you will be teleported there!

{alt} 215  -     Causes an hour of game time to pass. Useful when you
                 are waiting for someone to return to their place of
                 business.
