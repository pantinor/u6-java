u6-java
=========

Was able to create TMX tilemap 1024x1024 with a few layers with this script.
The function was derived from other examples found here on github and in the Nuvie project with some help from their development team.
May try to get animations working here in the future, in the Tiled tilemap (src\main\resources\u6world.tmx) that was created.
